### Reflection
I once again feel as though I've set my scope too grand for the time I alotted myself. I came close to the mark on features I wanted to impliment and I'm satisfied with how the game plays and what I've learned. However, my code fell apart the closer the deadline came. I didn't have the time to look through notes and figure out why the "correct" way of doing things wasn't working. This lead to a lot of band-aid solutions that would have been even worse to deal with had this been abigger project. In the future I will put more effort into testing and troubleshooting sample code to build a game ontop of. 

- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] C-1: The tutorial has been completed.
- [X] B-1: Your repository is well-formed, in our course organization, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, a single mainline branch named <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our commit message style guide</a>.
- [X] B-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
